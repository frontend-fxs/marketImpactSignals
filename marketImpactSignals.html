					In the last five releases, the EUR/USD moved, on average, 43 pips in the 15 minutes after the release and 84 pips in the
					4 hours after the release.
				</p>
				<p>
					The previous release had surprise of +1.24 measured in terms of deviation, and the EUR/USD reached the 83 pips of volatility
					15 minutes after the release and 111 in the following four hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					If it comes out at higher than expected with a deviation of +1.53 or higher, the pair may go down reaching a range of 36
					pips in the first 15 minutes and 64 pips in the following 4 hours. If it comes out lower than expected at a deviation
					of -1.46 or less, the EUR/USD may go up reaching a range of 25 pips in the first 15 minutes and 126 pips in the following
					4 hours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Support levels are to be found approximately at 1.2260 and 1.2200 accordingly to the Confluence Indicator. On the upside,
					we are watching resistance at 1.2320 and 1.2410.

				</p>
				<p>
					From a positioning perspective, supply is noted between 1.2400 and 1.2440. Strong vestiges of demand can be seen around 1.2260
					and again at 1.2210, based on aggregated trading positions from FXStreet's dedicated contributors.

				</p>
				<p>
					Only 33% of EUR-based pairs are in bullish mode against a basket of 20 world currencies accordingly to the EUR-Bullish Percentage
					Index. As such, a release which surprises the market with a negative trigger (USD negative) may lead to a stronger up
					move in the EUR/USD.
